Hi! I'm Luyao.👋

I'm a student passionate about artificial intelligence, data science, and creating things that make life a little easier (or a little prettier ✨).  

This site is my digital notebook where I share my projects, learning notes, and personal thoughts.

📍 Currently based in Bologna.  
🎯 Learning Python, machine learning, and how to be less afraid of the future.  
🍵 Loves coffee, quiet evenings, and friendly conversations.

Feel free to explore and reach out! 😊
